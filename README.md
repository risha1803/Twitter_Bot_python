# Twitter_Bot_python
A bot -- short for robot and also called an internet bot -- is a computer program that operates as an agent for a user or other program or to simulate a
human activity. Bots are normally used to automate
certain tasks, meaning they can run without specific
instructions from humans. Bots are mainly
categorized into two categories: good and bad bots;
good bots consist of web crawlers and chatbots
whereas bad bots consist of malicious bots which
make up 20% of the traffic.

OUR AIM - Our project aims at identification of these
malicious and bad bot twitter accounts
based on parameters like user name,
follower count , verified, status of the
account etc. 
To accomplish this
we analysed the data on the basis of follower and following
count and searched for specific words that a bot account may
have. We implemented three machine learning models:

• Naive Bayes

• Random Forest

• Decision Tree

The system detects bots based on the follower count, the
following count, screen names, description, and whether the
account is verified or not.
